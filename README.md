TheBigDB issues
===============

Hello!  
While TheBigDB isn't open-source (yet?), I'm a big fan of Github's Issues functionality, so here is an empty repo just for that purpose.  
  
=> **[TheBigDB issues](https://github.com/thebigdb/thebigdb-issues/issues)** <=  
  
You can talk about pretty much anything you want, from bugs to feature requests, including general questions. 
Please note that you can also contact us on Twitter [@TheBigDBdotcom](https://twitter.com/TheBigDBdotcom) or via email <christophe@thebigdb.com>

Thanks!
